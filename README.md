## Questions for supervisors

### Who is Mart?

Mart is a ?14 year old scholar,
that follows Richel's programming course.
He ahs been the lead tester of the game Nature Zen.

### What should I do during my slot

You can fill the time in any way you like.

Consider:

 * telling/showing your work
 * teaching some basic biology
 * show the lab/campus/etc
 * taking a walk

### A slot of 45 minutes is too long for one person

Slots can also be filled with more than one person :wink:

### Aaah! I cannot be there! What should I do?

It's fine. Just let Richel, Mart or any colleague know. 
We'll find a solution :+1:

### What is the goal of the internship?

To learn how working at a university is like.

### What will the interns deliver?

At that day, they'll hand in a report to answer the question:

> How do biologists investigate nature?
