## Questions for supervisors

### Who is Mart?

Mart is a ?14 year old scholar,
that follows Richel's programming course.
He has been the lead tester of the game Nature Zen.

### What should I do during my slot

You can fill the time in any way you like.

Perhaps the most useful thing to do,
is to explain your work to the intern,
to verify that that you can (still) explain your scientific work to laymen.

Consider:

 * telling/showing your work
 * teaching some basic biology
 * showing some code/scripts 
 * show the lab/campus/Peregrine/etc
 * taking a walk

### A slot of 45 minutes is too long for one person

Slots can also be filled with more than one person :wink:

### Aaah! I cannot be there! What should I do?

It's fine. Just let Richel, Mart or any colleague know. 
We'll find a solution :+1:

### What is the goal of the internship?

To learn how working at a university is like.

### What will the interns deliver?

At that day, they'll hand in a report to answer the question:

> How do biologists investigate nature?
