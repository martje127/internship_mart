what did i learn? I have learned what these people think about theoretische biologie. every body thinks different
about theoretical biology some use simulatans and equatans in there answer and some do not.

if i did not wrote everithing somewon told me. it can be i did not wrote it down because i was listening to that person
this was my report i hope you liked reading.
